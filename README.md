visuospatial tracking &amp; judgement game

This my first ever webgame/website/etc and I could only take a few days off to make this, so take that as you will.

The game by default provides 2 reference points and 0 points the player has to ignore. The settings for how many of each can be
changed by editing the code. The task is to hover your cursor in a way that will move the green point(just the one you can control) 
to the weighted midpoint of the 2 reference points. Weighted, since the size of the points also determines which point has more "attractive"
influence on the solution point.
