# vtracker
visuospatial tracking &amp; judgement game

This my first ever webgame/website/etc and I could only take a few days off to make this, so take that as you will.

The game by default provides 2 reference points and 0 points the player has to ignore. The settings for how many of each can be
changed by editing the code. The task is to hover your cursor in a way that will move the green point(just the one you can control) 
to the weighted midpoint of the 2 reference points. Weighted, since the size of the points also determines which point has more "attractive"
influence on the solution point. You can see how this works by clicking "v" to see the solution point(also in green). Scoring depends on the distance between the calculated solution green point and your cursor's green point. If you do everything perfectly, you will score 10% more than the "maximum score"
but that is highly unlikely. Based on reaction timing and natural coordination abilities, I'd say an 85% score(score/max score) is very successful, and you should move on to more reference and/or ignored points. Once you get to 4+ reference points, you will notice that statistically it is unlikely
that the solution point/range area will lie far off the center of the grid, and this makes it easier for you to gain more points â€” this is an issue I haven't addressed yet but will in the future(one idea is to put more weight on the size when calculating the solution point position). There is also somehow a tendency for the reference/ignored points to move faster with increasing run time, which makes things harder.

Keep in mind, it takes a few tries to get the hang of how things work, but if you use the score changes to figure things out it's really not too hard, just impossible to do perfectly. Focus on your peripheral vision of the reference points.

Lmk if you have any suggestions! Thanks :)
