# vtracker
visuospatial tracking &amp; judgement game

This my first ever webgame/website/etc and I could only take a few days off to make this, so take that as you will.

The game by default provides 2 reference points and 0 points the player has to ignore. The settings for how many of each can be
changed by editing the code. The task is to hover your cursor in a way that will move the green point(just the one you can control) 
to the weighted midpoint of the 2 reference points. Weighted, since the size of the points also determines which point has more "attractive"
influence on the solution point. You can see how this works by clicking "v" to see the solution point(also in green). Scoring depends on the distance between the calculated solution green point and your cursor's green point.

Lmk if you have any suggestions! Thanks :)
