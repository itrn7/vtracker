# vtracker
visuospatial tracking &amp; judgement game

This my first ever webgame/website/etc! Very excited to share.

The game by default provides 2 reference points and 0 points the player has to ignore. The settings for how many of each can be
changed using the given UI. The task is to hover your cursor in a way that will move your cursor's point(the one you can control, initially black) 
to the weighted midpoint of the 2 reference points. Weighted, since the size of the points also determines which point has more "attractive"
influence on the solution point. You can see how this works by clicking "v" to see the solution point(in green, with a red centerpoint). Scoring depends on the distance between the calculated solution point and your cursor's point. If you do everything perfectly, you will score 10% more than the "maximum score" but that is highly unlikely. Based on reaction timing and natural coordination abilities, I'd say an > 80% score(score/max score) is incredibly successful, and you should move on to more reference and/or ignored points. Once you get to 4+ reference points, you will notice that statistically it is unlikely that the solution point/range area will lie far off the center of the grid, and this makes it easier for you to gain more points â€” this is an issue I haven't addressed yet but will in the future(one idea is to put more weight on the size when calculating the solution point position). 

Keep in mind, it takes a few tries to get the hang of how things work, but if you use the score changes and provided real time feedback to figure things out it's really not too hard, just impossible to do 100% perfectly. Focus your attention on your peripheral vision of the reference points.

Lmk if you have any suggestions! Thanks :)
